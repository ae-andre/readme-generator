# README Generator

A command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input.

The [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4) was used to ease the processes of asking questions, parsing input, validating answers, and managing hierarchical prompts.

The [Professional README Guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide) was referenced to ensure the outputted README would be high-quality.
